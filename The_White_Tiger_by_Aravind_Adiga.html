<center><b> Book Summary </center> </b>
<br>
<span class="ital">The White Tiger</span> is the story of <span class="inline-character">Balram Halwai</span>’s life as a self-declared “self-made entrepreneur”: a rickshaw driver’s son who skillfully climbs India’s social ladder to become a chauffer and later a successful businessman. Balram recounts his life story in a letter to visiting Chinese official <span class="inline-character">Premier Wen Jiabao</span>, with the goal of educating the premier about entrepreneurship in India. </p> <p class="plot-text">Balram writes from his luxurious office in the city of Bangalore, but the story begins in his rural ancestral village of Laxmangahr. Throughout his childhood, Balram’s destitute family lives at the mercy of four cruel, exploitative landlords, referred to as “The Animals”: <span class="inline-character">The Raven</span>, <span class="inline-character">The Stork</span>, <span class="inline-character">The Buffalo</span>, and <span class="inline-character">The Wild Boar</span>.<span class="inline-character"> </span>Despite the difficult life he is born into, Balram excels in school. His academic potential and personal integrity distinguish him from his classmates, bringing him to the attention of a visiting school <span class="inline-character">inspector</span> who nicknames him “<span class="inline-symbol">the White Tiger</span>,” after the most rare and intelligent creature in the jungle. </p> <p class="plot-text">Balram’s parents recognize his potential and want him to complete his education, but his grandmother <span class="inline-character">Kusum</span> removes him from school early on so that he can work to support the family. Balram is determined to continue his education however he can. When he and his brother <span class="inline-character">Kishan</span> begin working in a teashop in nearby Dhanbad, Balram neglects his duties and spends his days listening to customers’ conversations. He overhears one customer speaking wistfully about the high earnings and easy life that India’s private chauffeurs enjoy, and begs his grandmother to send him to driving school. Kusum agrees, but Balram must promise to send home his wages once he finds a job. </p> <p class="plot-text">His training complete, Balram knocks on the doors of Dhanbad’s rich families, offering his services. By a stroke of luck, he arrives at the mansion of the Stork (one of Laxmangahr’s animal landlords) one day after the Stork’s son, <span class="inline-character">Mr. Ashok</span>, returns from America with his wife <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam</span>. The family hires Balram to become Ashok’s driver. In reality, Balram is more of a general servant to the family, while another servant, <span class="inline-character">Ram Persad</span>, has the privilege of driving them.</p> <p class="plot-text">Balram learns that the Stork’s family fortune comes from illegally selling coal out of government mines. They bribe ministers to turn a blind eye to their fraudulent business and allow the family to avoid paying income tax. Unfortunately, the family recently had a disagreement with the region’s ruling politician, referred to as <span class="inline-character">the Great Socialist</span>. The family dispatches Ashok and Pinky to Delhi, where Ashok will distribute more bribes to make amends. When Balram learns that the couple will need a driver in Delhi, he schemes to have Ram Persad dismissed, and goes in his place. </p> <p class="plot-text">Once in Delhi, Balram witnesses Pinky and Ashok’s marriage rapidly fall apart. Pinky returns to the US and leaves her husband after she kills a young child in a drunken, hit-and-run accident. In her absence, Ashok goes out to bars and clubs, hiring a prostitute one night, and reconnecting with a former lover on another. Observing his master’s gradual corruption and driving him through Dehli’s seedier districts, Balram becomes disillusioned and resentful. Although Ashok is a relatively kind master, Balram realizes that whatever generosity Ashok has shown him is only a fraction of what he can afford. Ashok has no real interest in helping Balram achieve a better life, or in changing the status quo.</p> <p class="plot-text">Balram plans to murder Ashok and escape with the bag of the money that he carries around the city to bribe politicians. In addition to the risk of being caught, Balram must contend with the logic of <span class="inline-symbol">“the Rooster Coop”:</span> the system of oppression in which India’s poor, including Balram himself, are trapped. Balram knows that if he kills Ashok, Ashok’s family will murder all his own relatives in Laxmangahr in retaliation. Balram is also held back by the arrival in Delhi of his young cousin<span class="inline-character"> Dharam</span>, who Kusum sends from Dhanbad with the demand that Balram help raise him.</p> <p class="plot-text">Balram finally resolves to proceed with the murder, using a weapon he has fashioned out of a broken liquor bottle. One day as he drives Ashok to deliver a particularly large bribe, Balram pretends that there is a mechanical problem with the car. He pulls over, convinces Ashok to kneel down and examine the wheel, then brings the broken bottle down on Ashok’s head. After killing his master, he returns to Ashok’s apartment, collects Dharam, and escapes with his young cousin to Bangalore. </p> <p class="plot-text">Once Balram regains his nerves in Bangalore enough not to fear immediate capture, he begins wandering the city and listening to conversations in cafes –just as he did in the teashop in Dhanbad—to plan his next move. He soon learns that Bangalore’s business world revolves around outsourcing, and that many large technology companies work on a nocturnal schedule. Balram creates a taxi company called White Tiger Drivers to bring call center workers home safely at night, and the venture is an enormous success.</p> <p class="plot-text">By the time he sits down to tell his story, Balram is a wealthy man who keeps to himself, still fearful that one day his crime will be discovered. However, he concludes his letter to Wen Jiabao claiming that even if he is found out, he will never regret his crime: it was worth committing simply because it enabled him to experience life as a free man rather than as a servant.</p>

<center><b> chapter-1-the-first-night </center> </b>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Indian entrepreneur Balram Halwai </span>(alias <span class="inline-character">Ashok Sharma</span>),<span class="inline-character"> </span><span class="inline-character">the novel’s narrator and protagonist,</span> begins composing a letter to Chinese official <span class="inline-character">Wen Jiabao</span>, who is visiting India on diplomacy. Balram expresses his excitement as a local businessman that Jiabao wants to understand the culture of Indian entrepreneurship, and claims that his life story is all Jiabao needs to hear in order to learn “the truth about India.” He warns Jiabao not to believe what politicians tell him, and not to buy the bootlegged American business books that children sell in the street.
<br>
<br>
To set the scene for <span class="inline-character">Jiabao</span>, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> describes the luxurious Bangalore office from which he writes, and explains that he will stay up all night to tell his story. This is no great hardship considering that all successful entrepreneurs must watch over their businesses night and day. He honors the Indian tradition of praying to the Gods before beginning a story, an act that he irreverently refers to as “Kissing the Gods’ arses,” before starting his narrative.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> refers to himself as a “half-baked Indian” because he was prevented from completing his formal education as a child. However, he claims that this lack of schooling was not necessarily a disadvantage, and that all Indian entrepreneurs are similarly “half-baked.” “Fully formed” Indians, on the other hand, go on to work in companies and have no entrepreneurial spirit.
<br>
<br>
To describe his physical appearance and basic biographical details, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> references a police poster that was issued for his arrest three years ago after an event that he describes as “an act of entrepreneurship.” He mocks the hazy, incomplete police report and fills in the missing information as he goes along. He particularly notes his outward transformation from the unfed peasant in the poster to the pudgy businessman he is today. He also mentions that as a child, he was simply called “Munna” or “boy,” until a schoolteacher assigned him the name “Balram”—the name of the god Krishna’s sidekick.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> goes on to describe his native village of Laxmangahr, in the poor, rural “India of Darkness,” in contrast to his current city of Bangalore, which he says is part of the urban, prosperous “India of Light.” Laxmangahr sits on the banks of the sacred Ganges River, where religious Hindus have cremated their dead for centuries and where Balram’s own <span class="inline-character">mother</span> was cremated when he was a young boy. He describes the traumatic experience of her funeral, how he was frightened not so much by the cremation but by the black river mud that sucked his mother’s ashes into its depths. Watching her sink into the earth, Balram faints from an overwhelming sense of oppression and futility. Despite its importance as a sacred site, he never returns.
<br>
<br>
Throughout his youth <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> is surrounded by poverty, disease, and malnutrition. His destitute family lives at the mercy of four cruel and exploitative landlords referred to collectively as “The Animals,” individually as <span class="inline-character">The Water Buffalo</span>, <span class="inline-character">The Raven</span>, <span class="inline-character">The Stork</span> and <span class="inline-character">the Wild Boar</span>. The Animals “feed” on the town, harassing women and taxing the villagers at every opportunity. ”
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram’s</span> father <span class="inline-character">Vikram Halwai </span>scrapes together a living as a rickshaw driver. His one ambition is to see his son complete his education and “live like a man.” Balram’s only understanding of what this might mean is based on his awe for <span class="inline-character">Vijay </span>the Bus Driver, who began as a pig farmer’s son but somehow works his way to a stable job, not to mention a fancy uniform and shiny silver whistle that all the young boys admire. Rumor has it that Vijay got his jobs in exchange for having sex with a politician, but this does not trouble Balram.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram’s</span> school, though underfunded and run by a corrupt <span class="inline-character">teacher</span> who steals funds because he himself has not been paid for months, is a place where he excels. He recounts a pivotal moment in his life when a visiting <span class="inline-character">school inspector</span> singles him out for his academic promise and integrity. The man calls Balram a “<span class="inline-symbol">White Tiger</span>,” the rarest and most noble animal in the jungle, and promises him a scholarship. Balram, used to a life of hardship in the Darkness, knows that this promise is too good to come true.
<br>
<br>
His intuition proves correct. Balram’s grandmother <span class="inline-character">Kusum</span> takes out a loan from <span class="inline-character">the Stork</span>, one of the four village landlords, to pay for a relative’s wedding. The Stork orders that Balram be taken out of school to work alongside the rest of his family and pay back the debt. Balram goes to work with his brother <span class="inline-character">Kishan </span>in the village teashop. Though this is a devastating turn of fate, Balram claims that his entrepreneurial spirit allows him­­ to take matters into his own hands, to turn this bad news into good news.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> ends this first installment of his story with a memory of <span class="inline-symbol">the Black Fort</span>: the only thing of beauty in his impoverished town. The fort is a grand old building on a hill above town, constructed by foreign occupiers years ago, which both fascinated and frightened Balram throughout his youth. He claims that his ability to appreciate its beauty marked him early on as different from his fellow villagers, destined not to remain a slave. When he returns to the village years later with his wealthy master <span class="inline-character">Mr. Ashok</span> and his mistress <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam</span>, he finally gets the courage to visit the fort alone. He looks out over the village from on high and spits. Eight months later, he reveals, he slits the throat of Mr. Ashok.
<br>
<center><b> chapter-2-the-second-night </center> </b>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> comments that he continues to feel a sense of loyalty and closeness to the murdered <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> and his former wife, <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam</span>. He attributes many of his best ideas to Ashok and his family, explaining that he learned much of what he knows about life and Indian society from listening in on their conversations. In fact, he describes himself not as an original thinker, but as an original listener. The strong bond he still feels with Ashok reflects his belief that murder is an intimate act: in a way, the murderer becomes responsible for the victim’s life and knows more about him than the victim’s family. Balram alone knows how Ashok’s story ends.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> first meets <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> in the city of Dhanbad, where he moves after his <span class="inline-character">father</span> dies from tuberculosis in a run-down hospital across the river from Laxmangahr. It is the only hospital in the region, yet <span class="inline-character">Kishan</span> and Balram arrive with their father only to find that there are no doctors there. A Muslim patient at the hospital explains that corrupt physicians and government officials scheme in order to avoid staffing village hospitals. All the patients crowd together and listen to his explanation with a certain pleasure, because, as Balram remarks, “stories of rottenness and corruption are always the best.” Their father dies on the floor of the hospital, never having seen a doctor.
<br>
<br>
After Balram’s <span class="inline-character">father’s</span> death, <span class="inline-character">Kusum</span> arranges Kishan’s marriage to a local girl in exchange for a large dowry, and then sends both <span class="inline-character">Kishan</span> and <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> to Dhanbad to work in a teashop. Balram had worked in a teashop in Laxmangahr, but was dismissed for eavesdropping on customers and neglecting his work. Instead of scrubbing the floors like the other employees whom he calls “human spiders” because of their insect-like way of crouching and cleaning, Balram tries to learn as much as possible from tea shop customers. Seduced by the moneyed atmosphere of Dhanbad, a city grown wealthy from the coal industry, Balram tries to learn all he can about his new home by eavesdropping on miners who come to the café.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram’s</span> “original listening” pays off. After hearing a miner discuss the high salaries earned by private drivers, Balram begs his family to pay for him to take driving lessons. <span class="inline-character">Kusum</span> Granny eventually agrees, so long as Balram promises to send the family his monthly earnings once he gets a job. Balram finds a driving instructor willing to take him on, though the man is skeptical that Balram, from a caste of sweet-makers, could ever be tough enough to be a driver. Balram proves his instructor wrong, however, and the instructor teaches him not only how to drive and fix a car; he also learns several life lessons about how to stand up for himself in the “jungle” that is the open road. As a reward for finishing the training, his instructor takes Balram to lose his virginity in Dhanbad’s red light district.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, <span class="inline-character">Balram’s</span> instructor can’t help him find a job, and so Balram strikes out to search for one on his own. He knocks on rich families’ doors to offer his services as an “experienced driver,” but is not rewarded for this so-called “entrepreneurial” behavior until at one house he meets <span class="inline-character">Mr. Ashok</span>. Ashok is the son of the <span class="inline-character">Stork</span> of Laxmangahr, and has recently returned to India from the United States.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Ashok</span>, <span class="inline-character">the Stork</span>, and Ashok’s older brother <span class="inline-character">Mukesh Sir</span> (also known as “the Mongoose”), question <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> about his caste and family background. Balram explains that his future masters ask these questions because they want to be able to locate his hometown so that they can punish his family members should he, Balram, step out of line after they hire him.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> convinces the <span class="inline-character">Stork’s</span> family of his trustworthiness and they take him on as a driver. Life in their home is relatively comfortable. Although Balram has to share a room with the family’s “number one” (i.e. first choice) driver, <span class="inline-character">Ram Persad</span>, Balram now has a roof over his head and one of the khaki uniforms he admired for so long. Though he is officially a “driver,” he is at the family’s general beck and call, cleaning, cooking, performing odd jobs, and even massaging the Stork’s feet each night. During the massages, the Stork and his sons discuss coal, politics, and China. Balram listens intently, absorbing everything “like a sponge” as an entrepreneur should, but also because he feels himself to be part of the family and that his masters’ fate will be his own.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> describes his relationship with <span class="inline-character">Ram Persad</span>, the family’s “number one” servant. (Balram is “number two.”) Though they sleep in the same room, they live in constant hatred of one another and compete in every aspect of their lives, including the number of Hindu idols they pray to. Ram Persad sleeps on a bed, while Balram sleeps on the floor. Ram Persad drives Ashok and Pinky Madam around in the luxurious Honda City, while Balram drives other members of the household in the less impressive Maruti Suzuki. The family’s third servant, referred to as “<span class="inline-character">the Nepali</span>” (though his actual name is <span class="inline-character">Ram Bahadur</span>), sides with Ram Persad and enjoys tormenting Balram by making him bathe the masters’ lapdogs, Cuddles and Puddles.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> gets his first opportunity to drive <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> and his wife in the Honda City when Ashok decides to visit Laxmangahr, their shared ancestral village. Balram drives the couple to lunch at the <span class="inline-character">Wild Boar’s</span> house. As Ashok and Pinky visit the Wild Boar in his beautiful home, Balram visits with his own family. During lunch, <span class="inline-character">Kusum</span> nags him for neglecting to send money, while praising his success and threatening to arrange his marriage. She serves him a rich chicken dish, which only serves to emphasize how thin and malnourished <span class="inline-character">Kishan</span> has become. Enraged by his family’s demands and their neglect of Kishan, Balram storms out of the house and climbs up to the <span class="inline-symbol">Black Fort</span>.
<br>
<br>
Up near the fort, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> looks down over Laxmangahr and spits. He compares this gesture to a poem by the Muslim poet Iqbal about God and the Devil. According to Balram, the Devil “was once God’s sidekick until he fought with Him and went freelance.” The Devil rejects God’s offer to become His servant, just as Balram spits down on the town below him, rejecting the circumstances into which God placed him and his own family’s seeming effort to lock him into an impoverished life of servitude. On the drive back to Dhanbad, however, Balram reflexively touches his finger to his eye when driving past a temple as a sign of faith and respect. His apparent devotion so impresses Pinky and Ashok that he repeats it multiple times, pretending that they have passed holy landmarks, all the way home.
<br>
<center><b> chapter-3-the-fourth-morning </center> </b>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> resumes his letter to <span class="inline-character">Premier Jiabao</span> with a critique of Indian democracy, and warns him not to believe the pamphlet describing the government that he will undoubtedly receive from the Indian politicians. Balram’s first experience with Indian democracy was when his employer at the teashop in Laxmangahr sold all his employees’ votes to the <span class="inline-character">Great Socialist</span>’s party, leaving Balram without any political voice. When the official at the local voting booth tells Balram he must be eighteen years old to vote, he agrees to register as an eighteen-year-old, effectively receiving a “birthday” from the government.
<br>
<br>
The <span class="inline-character">Great Socialists</span>’ party dominated politics in the Darkness at the time of the first election in which <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> could vote. While the Great Socialist presents himself as a populist leader favoring the poor, he and his corrupt ministers murdered, raped, embezzled funds, and rigged elections to stay in power. His hold over the region is so complete and uncontested that any citizen who thinks he can vote for himself, for or against the Great Socialist party, is considered mad.
<br>
<br>
The <span class="inline-character">Great Socialist</span> secured his power in Laxmangahr by cutting deals with the four local landlords (<span class="inline-character">Stork</span>, <span class="inline-character">Raven</span>, <span class="inline-character">Wild Boar</span>, <span class="inline-character">Buffalo</span>). In this particular voting year, however, the landlords are unhappy with the terms of their political agreement, and start their own oppositional party against the Great Socialist. <span class="inline-character">Vijay</span>, who has transformed himself from a bus driver into a political activist, outspokenly supports the Great Socialist against the new party. Finally, the two sides appear to reach an agreement, and the police arrive in town as they have during each preceding election to intimidate the townspeople and inform them, essentially, that going to the polls is useless: their votes will not be counted and the election will be tallied in favor of the Great Socialist.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> recounts how on one election day, a rickshaw puller “went mad” and approached the polls, attempting to vote for himself. When he arrived at the polls where the <span class="inline-character">Great Socialists</span> had already “tallied” the votes (all in favor of their party), <span class="inline-character">Vijay</span> and a policeman beat him with sticks and then, with their feet, “stamp him into the earth.” Balram breaks into his narrative to point out the injustice of his being wanted for murder by the Indian police, who routinely terrorize and kill the poor.
<br>
<br>
After this brief history of Indian democracy as he knows it, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> returns to describing the present elections. A few days after the trip to Laxmangahr, <span class="inline-character">Vijay</span> and the <span class="inline-character">Great Socialist</span> each separately visit the <span class="inline-character">Stork’s</span> family in Dhanbad. The Great Socialist demands a large sum of money from the family, presumably to punish their grab for political power. When the family protests, the politician reminds them that he has turned a blind eye all these years when they stole coal from government mines, apparently the source of their fortune. Balram listens in on the conversations that follow: <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span>, <span class="inline-character">Mukesh Sir</span>, and <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam</span> decide that they have to move to Delhi to ensure that they can bribe the right people and protect their business.
<br>
<br>
The <span class="inline-character">Nepali</span> tells <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> about the couple’s move to Delhi, and that he will help him go in exchange for 5,000 rupees: otherwise, <span class="inline-character">Ram Persad</span> would be the obvious choice. Desperate to go, Balram begins to scheme and watch Ram Persad closely. Persad had recently begun behaving strangely, cooking at night, eating alone, and disappearing from the master’s house at the same time each evening. Balram follows Ram Persad, and his suspicions are confirmed: the man is a Muslim, observing Ramadan. With the help of the Nepali, Ram Persad has concealed his faith from his Hindu master, who is deeply prejudiced against Muslims. Balram makes his discovery known to both the Nepali and Ram Persad, effectively blackmailing them so as to reverse the hierarchy among them to become “number one,” and earning the right to travel to Delhi.
<br>
<center><b> chapter-4-the-fourth-night </center> </b>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> describes Delhi’s luxury high-rise apartment blocks, and its confusing network of roads and alleys where drivers are easily lost. In order to please <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam</span>, who misses America, <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> has rented an apartment in the modern, Americanized suburb of Gurgaon. Balram gets lost repeatedly as he tries to find the apartment building: <span class="inline-character">Mukesh Sir</span> scolds him, while Ashok defends him and catches his eye with a pitying look.
<br>
<br>
Shortly after arriving in Delhi, <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span>, <span class="inline-character">Pinky</span> and <span class="inline-character">Mukesh Sir</span> go shopping. <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> waits outside the mall with the other drivers, one of whom he refers to as <span class="inline-character">Vitiligo Lips</span>. (Vitiligo is a skin disease that results in loss of skin color; treatment can reduce its impact, but not cure it.) Vitiligo Lips calls Balram “Country Mouse” and gives him tips on how to survive as a driver in Delhi: he stresses the importance of keeping one’s mind occupied during long waits on the job, and offers Balram a trashy magazine called “Murder Weekly” which all the drivers read. He also says he can help Balram find prostitutes and foreign liquor for Ashok: Balram refuses and insists that Ashok is a good man.
<br>
<br>
A few days after his exchange with <span class="inline-character">Vitiligo Lips</span>, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> takes <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> and <span class="inline-character">Mukesh Sir</span> to deliver bribes to ministers. He drives them to their destinations in the Honda City, which is like a “dark egg” sealed protectively against Delhi’s polluted air. After the brothers deliver their final bribe of the day, they drive past a well-known statue of Gandhi. Ashok, angered by the irony of passing this statue after bribing government officials, repeats, “It’s a fucking joke.”
<br>
<br>
Partially because of his tense relationship with <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam</span>, <span class="inline-character">Mukesh Sir</span> returns to Dhanbad. When <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> brings him to the railway station, Mukesh Sir issues several orders about how he should behave as a driver, and tries to convince <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> to discipline Balram. Ashok waves off his brother and assures him that Balram is honest, that there is no cause for alarm. This is a crucial moment for Balram, who recognizes that his master is weak, vulnerable, and unused to having servants.
<br>
<br>
Soon after <span class="inline-character">Mukesh Sir’s</span> departure, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> begins a process of self-improvement. He tries to reform his bad habits and starts taking better care of his appearance. He stops chewing Paan, the tobacco-like substance, and attempts to distance himself from the other drivers, choosing to meditate alone in his car rather than keep them company. He buys a western t-shirt and sneaks into one of Dehli’s shopping malls, usually off limits to the poor. He declares this adventure, “His first experience of being a fugitive.”
<br>
<br>
On the evening of <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam’s</span> birthday, <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> orders <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> to dress as a Maharaja and serve the pair dinner. However, after dinner Ashok and Pinky get into a fight, and then ask Balram to drive them into Delhi for a drink. Afterwards, Pinky insists on driving them home even though she is drunk, and the car collides with an unidentified “small black thing” that dies instantly. Suspecting that they have killed a young child, Balram takes the wheel and speeds back to the apartment. He confirms that the accident’s victim was a human child, but “reassures” Ashok that the child was “one of <i>those </i>people”: a homeless wanderer who no one will look for, who’s family will not press charges.
<br>
<br>
The next morning, <span class="inline-character">Mukesh Sir</span> arrives from Dhanbad and summons <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> to the apartment. After telling Balram that he is “part of the family,” the Mongoose makes him sign a document stating that Balram, not <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam</span>, was driving the car that hit the unidentified person. The Mongoose reveals that he is prepared to bribe the judge assigned to their case, and that Balram’s grandmother <span class="inline-character">Kusum</span> approves of this course of action. Balram breaks into his narrative to comment that, as outrageous as it seems, servants in India are often framed for crimes committed by their masters. Rather than protest, the servants’ families feel only pride that their relatives serve their masters with such loyalty.
<br>
<center><b> chapter-5-the-fifth-night </center> </b>
<br>
To explain how and why his masters feel justified in framing him for the hit-and-run accident, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> introduces the metaphor of the <span class="inline-symbol">Rooster Coop</span>. As he sees it, India’s poor are like roosters crowded together in cages, watching one another go to the slaughter yet unable or unwilling to escape the same fate. India’s wealthy few have oppressed the poor so completely that the poor do not rebel, and instead perpetuate their own oppression. Balram goes on to explain that the Indian family unit is the reason the Rooster Coop stays intact, and that it takes a <span class="inline-symbol">White Tiger</span>, someone willing to see his family destroyed, to escape.
<br>
<br>
Having signed away his life in taking responsibility for killing the child, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> sits in his room terrified and alone until <span class="inline-character">the Stork</span>, recently arrived in Delhi, summons him to the family’s apartment. Instead of discussing Balram’s future and what Balram fears will be his upcoming incarceration, the Stork asks him to massage his feet. They sit in silence until <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam</span> enters the room and reminds them to tell Balram that he is free: through a contact in the police force, the family has discovered that no one saw the accident and charges will not be pressed.
<br>
<br>
A few days later, <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam</span> wakes Balram early in the morning and has him drive her to the airport. She leaves Balram an envelop with money before catching a plane back to the US, leaving India forever and putting an end to her marriage. Later, <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> becomes furious with <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> for helping Pinky escape and nearly throws Balram over a railing, but Balram knocks Ashok back by kicking him in the chest and defends himself by saying he didn’t know what Pinky intended, and Ashok’s anger soon turns into sadness. Over the following days and weeks, Balram begins to care for Ashok, cooking for his master and comforting him. Any anger Balram himself felt towards Ashok for attempting to blame the hit-and-run accident on him is overtaken by pity.
<br>
<br>
The <span class="inline-character">Mongoose</span> arrives in Delhi to help <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> through his separation from <span class="inline-character">Pinky</span>, and also bearing a letter to <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> from <span class="inline-character">Kusum</span> Granny. Ashok and the Mongoose read aloud the letter, in which Kusum urges Balram to marry and subtly blackmails him to send money to his family, which he has neglected to do for months. Balram feels tempted by the short-term comforts of marriage, but knows he will never attain a higher social position or better life for himself if he allows himself to be saddled with the responsibilities of caring for a family.

<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> claims that Delhi corrupted him, made him capable of murder and rebellion, only after the city corrupted <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span>. After <span class="inline-character">Pinky</span>'s departure, Ashok begins going out to bars and clubs at night. As his driver on these trips, Balram experiences Delhi's sordid underbelly. He feels that Ashok’s desire for women is contagious, and responds almost immediately to Ashok’s lust by feeling it himself.
<br>
<br>
During one of <span class="inline-character">Ashok’s</span> evenings out, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> wanders into a nearby bookshop to pass the time. He chats with the bookseller and asks to stand near the books, just to feel the “electricity” of knowledge they give off. He mulls over <span class="inline-character">Pinky Madam’s</span> parting gift to him of 4700 rupees, and concludes that this money represented just a small part of the money she had withdrawn for herself. After he returns Ashok to the apartment building, he drives the Honda City recklessly around Delhi and spits all over the car.
<br>
<br>
The following evening, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> drives <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> around the city to deliver bribes. One <span class="inline-character">minister’s assistant</span> joins Ashok in the car and convinces him to hire a beautiful Ukrainian prostitute. When Ashok guiltily complies, Balram observes the woman from the front seat and is fascinated by her golden-haired, exotic western looks. After Ashok goes home, Balram drives back to the hotel where the men took the prostitute, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. When this fails, he takes another forbidden drive around Delhi. He feels that something is burning inside him, that the city reflects and feeds his angry, rebellious feelings.
<br>
<center><b> chapter-7-the-sixth-night </center> </b>
<br>
Soon after <span class="inline-character">Ashok’s</span> evening with the <span class="inline-character">minister’s assistant</span>, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> asks <span class="inline-character">Vitiligo Lips</span> to find him a golden haired prostitute. He also asks the older driver for advice on how to cheat his master. Balram begins selling petrol from the Honda City’s tank, visiting corrupt mechanics that overcharge for repairs, and using the car as a freelance taxi. He finds that each time he cheats Ashok, he doesn’t feel guilt but rage. Balram claims that he was “growing a belly” at last.
<br>
<br>
Using the money he stole from <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span>, Balram hires a golden-haired prostitute with the help of <span class="inline-character">Vitiligo Lips</span>. To his disappointment, she is not nearly as attractive as Ashok’s Ukrainian girl. He learns that her name means, “Girl” just his former name, “Munna,” means “Boy” in Hindi. Balram discovers quickly that the girl’s hair is not naturally blonde but dyed, and gets into a brawl with the manager. He is thrown out of the hotel without having had sex at all.
<br>
<br>
When <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> returns home, <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> is waiting for him in the servants’ quarters. Ashok claims that he is tired of living the comfortable yet soulless life of a rich Indian man. He says that he constantly allows himself to be exploited, and yet doesn’t have the courage to change his ways. He asks Balram to bring him to a teashop where he can eat like a “simple man.” At the teashop Balram orders Ashok enough food to feed a family, and watches resentfully as Ashok eats it all.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> continues to bribe ministers on schedule, distributing money in a red, Italian leather bag. One morning, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> brings the red bag down to the car while Ashok finishes getting ready. He opens the bag and, dazzled by the enormous quantity of money inside, can’t rid himself of the thought of stealing it. He thinks to himself that taking the money wouldn’t in fact be stealing, but recovering what is rightfully owed him. Ashok planned to distribute the money to avoid paying income tax, which—had it been paid—would have gone to helping poor people like Balram.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> mulls over the possibility of stealing the money as he roams Delhi’s streets, seeing everywhere symbols of his own oppression and looking for a sign as to what he should do next. He stops at a book market where a <span class="inline-character">Muslim bookseller</span> reads him a poem: “You were looking for the key for years/ But the door was always open!” He asks the man if poetry can make a man “vanish,” then flees the bookseller’s suspicious gaze. He visits the butchers’ quarter in Old Delhi, where he sees a buffalo pulling a cart loaded with the heads of dead buffalos, the faces of which seem to resemble the faces of his own family.
<br>
<br>
The following day, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> finds an iron wrench in the parking lot outside <span class="inline-character">Ashok’s</span> apartment complex. Intending to use it as a weapon, he brings it back to his room where –to his great surprise—he finds his young cousin <span class="inline-character">Dharam</span>. Balram then learns that <span class="inline-character">Kusum</span> sent Dharam to Delhi for Balram to mentor, along with a letter threatening to arrange a marriage for Balram in his absence. She also threatens to tell the <span class="inline-character">Stork’s</span> family that Balram hasn’t sent back any money in months. The new responsibility of caring for Dharam saves Balram “from the edge of the precipice,” and forces him to admit to himself that he has been plotting murder.
<br>
<br>
Shortly after <span class="inline-character">Dharam’s</span> arrival, <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> learns that the ruling national government has lost the election to several oppositional parties, including the <span class="inline-character">Great Socialist’s</span> party. The <span class="inline-character">Stork’s</span> family had anticipated that the government would win by a landslide, and is frantic because they neglected to bribe the winning parties. Ashok hurries to fix the mess. <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> drives him to meet with two of the Great Socialist’s representatives and, after agreeing to pay a large sum of money, Ashok loans them the use of his car. Balram is shocked to discover that one of the men he is driving is his childhood hero <span class="inline-character">Vijay</span>, who has “changed uniforms again” for the suit and tie of an Indian businessman.
<br>
<br>
Over glasses of Johnny Walker Black whiskey, <span class="inline-character">Vijay</span> and his companion discuss how they will be sure to get the correct amount of money from <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span>, and decide that it is not worth the trouble of threatening him with physical violence, as he doesn’t have the courage or cunning to avoid paying up. They move on to discuss the election, and in particular the good fortune that their party has a foothold in Bangalore, the city they believe holds the future of Indian business. After they exit the car, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> takes the bottle of whiskey they left behind and smashes it on the pavement, creating a sharp-edged weapon.
<br>
<br>
The following morning, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> asks <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> for time off so that he can take <span class="inline-character">Dharam</span> to the Delhi Zoo. Balram’s nerves are on edge all morning with the knowledge of the crime he plans to commit. When he and Dharam come upon a <span class="inline-symbol">white tiger</span> pacing back and forth in his cage, Balram locks eyes with the animal and faints. Back at the apartment, Balram dictates a letter for Dharam to write down. The letter is written as if from Dharam’s point of view, and ends with Dharam witnessing Balram regain consciousness from his faint, and Balram crying out that an apology to his <span class="inline-character">Kusum Granny</span>, but that he cannot keep living in a cage all his life. He orders Dharam to mail the letter to Kusum Granny as soon as he, Balram, leaves in the car with Ashok the next day.
<br>
<br>
The following morning, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span>drives <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> from bank to bank to fill the red bag with money for his master’s final bribe. As they drive towards the Sheraton Hotel to deliver the complete sum, Balram pretends that there is a problem with one of the car’s wheels and pulls over. He convinces Ashok to exit the car, kneel down and examine the wheel. As Ashok does so, Balram brings the broken bottle of Johnny Walker Black down on Ashok’s head from behind, then turns him around and stabs him in the throat. (He remarks that this is how Muslims kill their chickens.) Balram explains that he killed Ashok rather than stunning him because he knows that Ashok’s family will brutally murder his own family once they discover Balram’s guilt: he is simply “getting his revenge in advance.”
<br>
<br>
The deed done, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> covers his tracks as best he can and scatters <span class="inline-character">Ashok’s</span> body with stickers of the holy goddess Kali, thinking that they may help his dead master’s soul reach heaven. He drives to the train station to make his escape, but is tortured with indecision about whether or not to rescue <span class="inline-character">Dharam</span>. He goes back to get his cousin in Gurgaon despite the risk of getting caught, and the two flee to Bangalore together.
<br>
<center><b> chapter-eight-the-seventh-night </center> </b>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> describes for <span class="inline-character">Wen Jiabao</span> how he went from living as a fugitive to becoming a pillar of Bangalore society. On their way to Bangalore after the murder, Balram and <span class="inline-character">Dharam</span> stop at a teashop where they discover a police poster out for Balram’s arrest. As Balram examines it “with a sense of pride.” an illiterate man approaches him and asks what crime the man in the poster has committed: he is unable to recognize Balram from the photo at all, as the photo looks like it could be of half the men in India.
<br>
<br>
Looking back on the period after the murder, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> estimates that it took him four weeks in Bangalore to calm his nerves. He explains that he is not like the Indian politicians who can kill and move on immediately. He and <span class="inline-character">Dharam</span> keep to themselves until Balram finally takes courage and ventures out into the city. He tries to “hear the city’s voice,” just as he heard Dehli’s by sitting at cafés and writing down what he overhears.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> quickly learns that Bangalore revolves around outsourcing, and companies that conduct business with Americans over the phone. Because of the time difference, men and women in Bangalore work on a nocturnal schedule. Balram realizes that the companies must need drivers to transport their employees back home safely at night, and resolves to start a taxi service that will do the job. After using some of the money he stole from Ashok to bribe the police to help eliminate his competition and make him appear as a legitimate businessman, he creates his “start-up”: <span class="inline-symbol">White Tiger</span> Drivers.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-symbol">White Tiger</span> Drivers is an immediate success, and <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> quickly becomes a wealthy man. He renames himself Ashok Sharma after his master, but unlike the late <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span> he keeps his employees at a respectful distance. He tries to set an example with his behavior in the hopes that they will move up in life. Balram claims that he doesn’t “insult” his employees by telling them they are like family, and simply asks that they do their jobs responsibly.
<br>
<br>
Despite his newfound wealth and power, <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> tries not to lose touch with the place he got his true education: the open road. As he wanders around Bangalore, he hears stirrings and rumors of revolution, of men trying to break out of the <span class="inline-symbol">Rooster Coop</span>. He doubts that anything will happen, because the Indian people wait passively for revolution to come from elsewhere, when in reality it is up to each individual to create his own revolution.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> changes gears to recount an incident that occurred a few nights earlier. One of his drivers, <span class="inline-character">Mohammad Asif</span>, hit and killed a boy who had been riding a bicycle. Balram ordered Asif to call the police, who Balram has bought off with many bribes, and thereby manages to prevent the family from registering the case. Luckily the police are not required to register a bicyclist’s death, as they would a motorcyclist’s or a driver’s.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> visits the victim’s parents the following day and expresses his deep sorrow for their loss, mentioning that he himself has lost many relatives. He gives them twenty-five thousand rupees and offers to train their other son as a driver in his company. Upon his return to the office, <span class="inline-character">Asif</span> asks <span class="inline-character">Balram</span> why he “wasted” so much money on the victim’s family, from whom the company had nothing to fear. Balram explains that he had to “do something different”— that he could not behave like the landlords of Laxmangahr. Balram explains further in his letter to Wen Jiabao: he (Balram) is in the Light now, where if a man wants to be good, he can be.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> addresses the question of guilt. He feels none towards <span class="inline-character">Ashok</span>: instead of dreaming that the dead man pursues him, Balram says that his nightmares are that he never committed the murder, and is still a servant in Delhi. Balram’s feelings about his family are more complicated. He assumes that the Stork’s family had his relatives killed, but tries not to dwell on their fate. To explain this seemingly monstrous attitude towards their deaths, he tells a story about the Buddha. When the Buddha was asked whether he was a man or a God, Buddha responded, “Neither. I am just one who has woken up while the others are sleeping.” Balram feels himself to have done the same.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> brings his letter to <span class="inline-character">Jiabao</span> to a close, writing that the act of sharing his story with its secrets about entrepreneurship represents a significant leap forward in relations between India and China. He describes with enthusiasm the rapid economic development of Bangalore, and how exciting it is to feel like he himself has contributed to its growth.
<br>
<br>
<span class="inline-character">Balram</span> proclaims that he is a first-gear man who looks at tomorrow instead of today: he knows he will become restless, sell his business, and move on to the next venture soon enough. He has already started purchasing real estate in Bangalore to lease to Americans, who he anticipates will soon flood the city. He imagines starting a school for poor children in Bangalore with his money, providing of course that he does not get caught for his crime. Yet Balram also feels that even if he is discovered, he will never regret what he did. In his eyes, the opportunity to experience living like a man, freed from servitude, has justified his crime.
